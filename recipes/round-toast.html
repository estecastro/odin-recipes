        <p>Watch everyone's mouth water while eating this soft, tender round roast steak</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) beef eye of round roast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine (merlot or cabernet sauvignon)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
            <li>Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the oil, salt, pepper, thyme and garlic into a paste, then rub all over the roast. Set aside at
                room temperature for 1 hour. Forty minutes into the hour, pre-heat the oven to 500 degrees F.</li>
            <li>On a baking sheet, place two sheets of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil large enough to cover the roast.
                Place the roast on the foil sheets and transfer everything to the oven. Roast for 6 minutes per pound.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the oven. Fold up the foil so it wraps the roast then return it to the oven. Reduce the oven
                temperature to 170 degrees F and roast for one hour. After an hour, check the internal temperature with
                an instant-read thermometer: 120-125 degrees F will yield a rare center, 130-140 degrees F will yield a
                medium-rare center, and 140-150 degrees F will yield a medium center.</li>
            <li>When the roast is finished, remove it and set it on a cutting board to rest. Transfer any drippings from
                the roast into a saucepan, then combine with the red wine and beef broth. Bring to a simmer over
                med-high heat and reduce by 1/4; reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in the cubes of butter one at a
                time until incorporated into the sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</li>
            <li>Slice the roast into 1/2 inch thick slices and serve with the pan sauce poured on top.</li>
        </ol>
